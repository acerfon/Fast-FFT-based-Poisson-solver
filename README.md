# Fast FFT-based Poisson solvers

These short MATLAB codes compute Poisson's equation with free space boundary conditions with spectral accuracy, only using FFTs, as described in F. Vico, L. Greengard, and M. Ferrando, ``Fast convolution with free-space Green's functions", Journal of Computational Physics 323, 191 (2016)
